"""
Passive liveness tracking for the two independent telemetry sensors
(Sysmon, ETW) - each sensor's start_monitor()/start_etw_monitor() calls
touch() every time it actually delivers an event, so a dead/tampered
sensor is visibly distinguishable from one that's merely quiet.

Deliberately observe-only: this watchdog logs staleness transitions and
exposes them to the dashboard, it never tries to restart a dead sensor.
Tearing down and re-establishing an EvtSubscribe handle or an ETW trace
session safely needs real handle-lifecycle care and live-fire testing
against genuine sensor death - both beyond what a non-elevated dev shell
can responsibly exercise. Auto-restart is a deliberate, separate follow-on.

Also derives one aggregate "blind state" (HEALTHY/DEGRADED/PARTIALLY_BLIND/
CRITICALLY_BLIND) from the two sensors' liveness - the point isn't "is the
watchdog thread alive" (it always is, once started), it's "how much of the
endpoint's behavioral telemetry can currently be trusted." Detection logic
should treat a lack of alerts differently depending on this state: silence
from a HEALTHY endpoint is evidence of no activity, silence from a
CRITICALLY_BLIND one is evidence of nothing at all.
